Development version from Subversion (SVN)
-----------------------------------------
Use the command::

  svn checkout http://pyspectrograph.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyspectrograph-read-only

Then type::

  cd pyspectrograph
  rm -rf build
  python setup.py install
 
INSTALLATION
============

First make sure that all PySpectrograph prerequisites are installed and working
properly.  

From tarballs
-------------
Unpack ``PySpectrograph-<version>.tar.gz``, change to the ``PySpectrograph-<version>/``
directory, and run
::

  python setup.py install

You may need to be root in order to this and if so, make sure that the root python
will install the package in the same directory as the user python. 
To install to a user-specific location instead, run::

  python setup.py install --prefix=$MYDIR

where $MYDIR is, for example, $HOME or $HOME/usr.

        ** Note 1: On Unix, you should avoid installing in /usr, but rather in
        /usr/local or somewhere else. /usr is generally 'owned' by your package
        manager, and you may overwrite a packaged PySpectrograph this way.

TESTING
=======

There are no tests currently available with this release, but you should be able 
to import the package after installation.

KNOWN INSTALLATION PROBLEMS
===========================

Currently None.
